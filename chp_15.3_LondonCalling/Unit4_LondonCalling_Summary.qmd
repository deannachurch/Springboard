## Overall Findings


* Determining where prices have risen the **most** is not straightforward
* Housing prices have increased over the last two decades
    + The average prices increase ranges from ~170K pounds - ~662K pounds
    + The ratio of of 1998 prices to 2018 prices ranges from 0.151 - 0.239
    + The order of boroughs differs between these two lists
* The complication arises because the starting price, ending price and rate of change impact these numbers and are variable for all of the boroughs.

## Average increase and ratio

Plots are ordered by 'bigger price change'.

\tiny Note: Richmond upon Thames is near the top when looking at the average price increase, but near the bottom when looking at the price ratio. 

\tiny Note: the price ratio gets smaller the larger the 2018 price is, so smaller ratios indicate a bigger price difference.


## Looking at increase over time

 Westminster ranks 'high' on both charts. It has a higher starting price and higher. On both plots, the rate (slope of the line) is variable over time, though by eye looks slightly steeper in parts on the Westminster plot.

## How I got here

* It was clearly important to look at the data in different ways
    + the 'average' change doesn't take rate, or starting/stopping values into account. 
    + The individual borough plots were quite useful. This made clear that the rate of change both varied over time, and varied (slightly less so) between boroughs. 
    + The ratio of of prices over a 2 decade span was also useful- but again a bit of a 'snapshot' that captures slightly different information than the mean average price does. 


## Main challenges

* Really getting the data cleaned appropriately is critical. 
* Sometimes understanding the wording of the questions was a bit challenging. 

## Next steps

I think it would be interesting to look at this data on a map. In particular, trying to correlate price changes to nearby features (schools, distance to a tube stop, etc) may be useful for getting a better handle on understanding why the differences vary so much.
