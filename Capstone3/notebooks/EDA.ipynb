GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the\nnumber of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a\nmore complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in\ndetail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau\nsearch. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems,\nthere is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of\nsatisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make\ndetailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the\naverage gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score\nand average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by\nshowing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis.\nThis work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to\nimprove understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",

         "As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning\nprocedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages.",

The system is an example of a learning-apprentice\nsoftware- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and\nsemantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned\ninformation to generate completion strings and construct a user interface.\nDescription of Online Appendix: People like to record information.

In our new note taking\nsoftwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the\ninterface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and\nconstructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of\nthe note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting\narchive.

This means that\npredictions by neural networks have biases which cannot be trivially\ndistinguished from being due to the true nature of the creation and observation\nof data or not. In order to attempt to address such issues we discuss Bayesian\nneural networks: neural networks where the uncertainty due to the network can\nbe characterised.

BNNs are comprised of a Probabilistic Model and a Neural\nNetwork. The intent of such a design is to combine the strengths of Neural\nNetworks and Stochastic modeling. Neural Networks exhibit continuous function\napproximator capabilities. Stochastic models allow direct specification of a\nmodel with known interaction between parameters to generate data. During the\nprediction phase, stochastic models generate a complete posterior distribution\nand produce probabilistic guarantees on the predictions. Thus BNNs are a unique\ncombination of neural network and stochastic models with the stochastic model\nforming the core of this integration. BNNs can then produce probabilistic\nguarantees on it's predictions and also generate the distribution of parameters\nthat it has learnt from the observations. That means, in the parameter space,\none can deduce the nature and shape of the neural network's learnt parameters.\nThese two characteristics makes them highly attractive to theoreticians as well\nas practitioners. Recently there has been a lot of activity in this area, with\nthe advent of numerous probabilistic programming libraries such as: PyMC3,\nEdward, Stan etc. Further this area is rapidly gaining ground as a standard\nmachine learning approach for numerous problems",

We propose a very natural\nasymptotic notion of consistency, and show that simple consistent algorithms\nexist, under most general non-parametric assumptions. The notion of consistency\nis as follows: two samples should be put into the same cluster if and only if\nthey were generated by the same distribution. With this notion of consistency,\nclustering generalizes such classical statistical problems as homogeneity\ntesting and process classification. We show that, for the case of a known\nnumber of clusters, consistency can be achieved under the only assumption that\nthe joint distribution of the data is stationary ergodic (no parametric or\nMarkovian assumptions, no assumptions of independence, neither between nor\nwithin the samples). If the number of clusters is unknown, consistency can be\nachieved under appropriate assumptions on the mixing rates of the processes.\n(again, no parametric or independence assumptions). In both cases we give\nexamples of simple (at most quadratic in each argument) algorithms which are\nconsistent.",

Directly parametrising this\nmap enables the use of expressive neural networks in small-data problems where\nneural networks would traditionally overfit. Neural processes can produce\nwell-calibrated uncertainties, effectively deal with missing data, and are\nsimple to train. These properties make this family of models appealing for a\nbreadth of applications areas, such as healthcare or environmental sciences.\n  This thesis advances neural processes in three ways.\n  First, we propose convolutional neural processes (ConvNPs). ConvNPs improve\ndata efficiency of neural processes by building in a symmetry called\ntranslation equivariance. ConvNPs rely on convolutional neural networks rather\nthan multi-layer perceptrons.\n  Second, we propose Gaussian neural processes (GNPs). GNPs directly\nparametrise dependencies in the predictions of a neural process. Current\napproaches to modelling dependencies in the predictions depend on a latent\nvariable, which consequently requires approximate inference, undermining the\nsimplicity of the approach.\n  Third, we propose autoregressive conditional neural processes (AR CNPs). AR\nCNPs train a neural process without any modifications to the model or training\nprocedure and, at test time, roll out the model in an autoregressive fashion.\nAR CNPs equip the neural process framework with a new knob where modelling\ncomplexity and computational expense at training time can be traded for\ncomputational expense at test time.\n  In addition to methodological advancements, this thesis also proposes a\nsoftware abstraction that enables a compositional approach to implementing\nneural processes.

         "In this paper we propose to learn a mapping from image pixels into a dense\ntemplate grid through a fully convolutional network. We formulate this task as\na regression problem and train our network by leveraging upon manually\nannotated facial landmarks \"in-the-wild\". We use such landmarks to establish a\ndense correspondence field between a three-dimensional object template and the\ninput image, which then serves as the ground-truth for training our regression\nsystem. We show that we can combine ideas from semantic segmentation with\nregression networks, yielding a highly-accurate \"quantized regression\"\narchitecture.\n  Our system, called DenseReg, allows us to estimate dense image-to-template\ncorrespondences in a fully convolutional manner. As such our network can\nprovide useful correspondence information as a stand-alone system, while when\nused as an initialization for Statistical Deformable Models we obtain landmark\nlocalization results that largely outperform the current state-of-the-art on\nthe challenging 300W benchmark. We thoroughly evaluate our method on a host of\nfacial analysis tasks and also provide qualitative results for dense human body\ncorrespondence. We make our code available at http://alpguler.com/DenseReg.html\nalong with supplementary materials.",
